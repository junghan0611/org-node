* org-node
** What's all this

I found org-roam too slow, so I made [[https://github.com/meedstrom/quickroam][quickroam]].  And that idea spun off into this package, a standalone thing.  I hope it's also easier to pick up than org-roam.

- *If you were using org-roam*, there is nothing to migrate.  You can use both packages.  It's exactly the same on-disk format: "notes" are identified by their org-id.

  With optional shims, you can even *skip syncing the org-roam DB* and continue using its rich backlinks buffer and org-roam-capture!

  In pursuit of being "just org-id", this package has no equivalent setting to =org-roam-directory= -- it just looks up =org-id-locations=.

- *If you were not using org-roam*, maybe think of it as somewhat like [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-recent-headings][org-recent-headings]] beefed-up to the extent that you won't need other methods of browsing.

  If you were the sort of person to prefer ID-links over file links or any other type of link, you're in the right place!  Now you can rely on IDs, and---if you want---forget about filenames, directories and subtree hierarchies.  As long as you've assigned an ID to a heading, you can find it later.

** What's a "node"?

My life can be divided into two periods "*before org-roam*" and "*after org-roam*".  I crossed a kind of gap once I got a good way to link between my notes.  It's strange to remember when I just relied on browsing subtrees and folders -- what an odd way to work!

I used to lose track of things I had written, under some forgotten heading in a forgotten file in a forgotten directory.  The org-roam method let me *find* and *build on* my own work, instead of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptomnesia][recreating my work]] all the time.

At the core, all the "notetaking packages" ([[https://github.com/rtrppl/orgrr][orgrr]]/[[https://github.com/localauthor/zk][zk]]/[[https://github.com/EFLS/zetteldeft][zetteldeft]]/[[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][org-roam]]/[[https://github.com/protesilaos/denote][denote]]/[[https://github.com/kaorahi/howm][howm]]/[[https://github.com/kisaragi-hiu/minaduki][minaduki]]/...) try to help you with this: make it easy to link between notes and explore them.

Right off the bat, that imposes two requirements: a method to search for notes, since you can't link to something you can't search for, and a design-choice about what kinds of things should turn up as search hits.  What's a "note"?

Just searching for Org files is too coarse.  Just searching for any subtree anywhere brings in too much clutter.

*Here's what org-roam invented.*  It turns out that if you limit the search-hits to just those files and subtrees you've deigned to assign an org-id -- which roughly maps to /everything you've ever thought it was worth linking to/ -- it filters out the noise excellently.

Once a subtree has an ID you can link to, it's a "node" because it has joined the wider graph, the network of linked nodes.  I wish the English language had more distinct sounds for the words "node" and "note", but to clarify, I'll say "ID-node" when the distinction matters.

** Features

A comparison of three similar systems, which permit relying on org-id and don't lock you into the all-too-common "one-note-per-file" concept.

* Setup

Add an init snippet like this (assuming [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight.el]]):

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package org-node
  :straight (org-node :type git :host github :repo "meedstrom/org-node")
  :after org
  :config (org-node-cache-mode))
#+end_src

** Quick start

If you're new to these concepts, fear not.  The main things for day-to-day operation are two verbs: "find" and "link".

Pick some short keys and try them out.

#+begin_src elisp
(keymap-set global-map "M-s M-f" #'org-node-find)
(keymap-set org-mode-map "M-s M-i" #'org-node-insert-link)
#+end_src

To browse config options, type =M-x customize-group RET org-node RET=.

Final tip: there's *no separate command* for creating a new node!  Reuse one of the commands above, then type the name of a node that doesn't exist.  Try it and see what happens!

** Use Org-roam at the same time?

These settings help you feel at home using both packages side-by-side:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-node-creation-fn #'org-node-new-via-roam-capture)
(setq org-node-slug-fn #'org-node-slugify-like-roam-actual)
(setq org-node-datestamp-format "%Y%m%d%H%M%S-")
#+end_src

If you've struggled in the past with big files taking a long time to save, consider these org-roam settings:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-roam-db-update-on-save nil) ;; don't update DB on save, not needed
(setq org-roam-link-auto-replace nil) ;; don't look for "roam:" links on save
#+end_src

Finally, make sure the underlying org-id knows about the files org-roam knows (you'd think it would, but that isn't a given!).

Either run =M-x org-roam-update-org-id-locations=, or edit the following setting so it includes your =org-roam-directory=.  Supposing that is "~/org/", set this:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-node-extra-id-dirs '("~/org/"))
#+end_src

With that done, try out the commands we went over in [[https://github.com/meedstrom/org-node?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start][Quick start]].  There's more under [[https://github.com/meedstrom/org-node?tab=readme-ov-file#toolbox][Toolbox]].  Enjoy!

** Backlink solution 1: borrow org-roam's backlink buffer
Backlinks are bread and butter.  As a Roam user, you can just keep using =M-x org-roam-buffer-toggle=, but you get some new ways to keep its data fresh, circumventing Roam's autosync mode.

*** Option 1A
*Let org-roam manage its own DB.*

If you didn't have laggy saves, this is fine.  In other words, keep variable =org-roam-db-update-on-save= at t.


*** *Option 1B*
*Tell org-node to write to the org-roam DB.*

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-roam-db-update-on-save nil)
(org-node-fakeroam-db-feed-mode)
#+end_src

Unfortunately, it is still a bit slow when I save a file with 400 nodes.  All down to EmacSQL -- if someone could help optimize how we call EmacSQL, that'd be much appreciated.  Until then, I recommend Option 1C.

Bonus: if you often have reason to full-reset the DB, there is a faster command than =C-u M-x org-roam-db-sync=!  Try =M-x org-node-fakeroam-db-rebuild=.  It does not require the aforementioned mode.

Another bonus: if the Roam backlinks buffer is sometimes slow, the minor mode =(org-node-fakeroam-redisplay-mode)= should speed it up.

*** *Option 1C*
*Cut out the DB altogether.*

No more battling SQLite!  Type =M-x org-node-fakeroam-nosql-mode=, then see what populates your Roam buffer henceforth.  Hopefully you see the same links as before.

If you're happy with the result, you can disable =org-roam-db-autosync-mode= entirely in favour of the slimmer =M-x org-node-fakeroam-redisplay-mode=.  As an init snippet:

#+begin_src elisp
(org-roam-db-autosync-mode 0)
(org-node-fakeroam-nosql-mode)
(org-node-fakeroam-redisplay-mode)
#+end_src

** Backlink solution 2: print inside the file
I rarely have the screen space to display a backlink buffer.  Because it needs my active involvement to keep visible, I go long periods seeing no backlinks.  This solution can be a great complement (or even stand alone).

*** *Option 2A*
*Let org-node add a :BACKLINKS: property to all nodes.*

For a first-time run, type =M-x org-node-backlink-fix-all=.  (Don't worry, if you change your mind, you can undo with =M-x org-node-backlink-regret=.)

Then start using the minor mode =org-node-backlink-mode=, which keeps these properties updated.  Init snippet:

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'org-node-backlink-mode)
#+end_src

*** *Option 2B*
*Let [[https://github.com/toshism/org-super-links][org-super-links]] manage a :BACKLINKS:...:END: drawer under all nodes.*

I /think/ the following should work. Totally untested, let me know!

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'org-node-insert-link-hook #'org-node-convert-link-to-super)
#+end_src

Bad news: this is currently directed towards people who used org-super-links from the beginning, or people who are just now starting to assign IDs, as there is not yet a command to add new BACKLINKS drawers in bulk to preexisting nodes. ([[https://github.com/toshism/org-super-links/issues/93][org-super-links#93]])

* Misc
** Org-capture

You may have heard that org-roam has its own special set of capture templates: the =org-roam-capture-templates=.

People who understand the magic of capture templates, they may take this in stride.  Me, I never felt confident using a second-order abstraction over an already leaky abstraction I didn't fully understand.

Can we just use vanilla org-capture?  That'd be less scary.  The answer is yes!

The secret sauce is =(function org-node-capture-target)=:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-capture-templates
      '(("i" "Capture into ID node"
         plain (function org-node-capture-target) nil
         :empty-lines-after 1)

        ("j" "Jump to ID node"
         plain (function org-node-capture-target) nil
         :jump-to-captured t
         :immediate-finish t)

        ;; Sometimes handy after `org-node-insert-link' to
        ;; make a stub you plan to fill in later
        ("q" "Make quick stub ID node"
         plain (function org-node-capture-target) nil
         :immediate-finish t)))
#+end_src

With that done, you can optionally tell the everyday commands =org-node-find= & =org-node-insert-link= to outsource to org-capture when creating new nodes:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-node-creation-fn #'org-capture)
#+end_src

** Node series
Do you already know about "daily-notes"?  Then get started with this command:

#+begin_src elisp
(keymap-set global-map "M-s M-s" #'org-node-series-dispatch)
#+end_src

It's easiest to explain series if we use "daily-notes" (or "dailies") as an example of a series.

A daily-note is the same idea as an [[https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal][org-journal]] entry: a file/entry where the title is just today's date.

You don't need software for that basic idea, but to make it extra convenient to navigate them and jump back and forth in the series.

Thus, fundamentally, any "journal" or "dailies" software are just operating on a sorted series.  I was resisting having to implement an equivalent to the Org-roam option =org-roam-dailies-directory=, so I ended up generalizing the concept and it's really powerful!

You could have series about, let's say, historical events, Star Trek episodes, your school curriculum...

Define more series in the variable =org-node-series=.

Already included is a definition that approximates the org-roam-dailies defaults, but I encourage you to override it to suit your tastes.

You may be taken aback that defining a new series requires writing 5 lambdas, but once you get the hang of it, you can often reuse those lambdas.

** Managing org-id-locations

I find unsatisfactory the config options in org-id (Why? See [[http://edstrom.dev/wjwrl/taking-ownership-of-org-id][Taking ownership of org-id]]), so org-node gives you an extra way to feed data to org-id, making sure we won't run into "ID not found" situations.

Example setting:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-node-extra-id-dirs
      '("/home/kept/org/"
        "~/Syncthing/project2/"
        "/mnt/stuff/"))
#+end_src

** Completion-at-point
It's not for everyone, but there is the option:

#+begin_src elisp
(org-node-complete-at-point-mode)
#+end_src

** Let org-open-at-point detect refs

Say there's a link to a web URL, and you've forgot you also have a node listing that exact URL in its =ROAM_REFS= property.

Wouldn't it be nice if, clicking on that link, you automatically visit to that node instead of being sent to the web?  Here you go:

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'org-open-at-point-functions #'org-node-try-visit-ref-node)
#+end_src

** Limitation: TRAMP
Working over TRAMP is untested, but I suspect it won't work.  Org-node tries to be very fast, often nulling =file-name-handler-alist=, which TRAMP needs.

The best way to change this is to [[https://github.com/meedstrom/org-node/issues][file an issue]] if you care :-)

** Limitation: unique titles
If two ID-nodes exist with the same title, one of them disappears from minibuffer completions.

That's just the nature of completion.  Other packages such as Roam have the same limitation.  Much can be said for embracing the uniqueness constraint, and org-node will print messages telling you about title collisions.

Anyway... there's a workaround.  Assuming you leave =org-node-affixation-fn= at its default setting, just set =org-node-alter-candidates= to t.

This lets you match against the node outline path and not only the title, which resolves most conflicts given that the most likely source of conflict is subheadings in disparate files, named the same.  [[https://fosstodon.org/@nickanderson/112249581810196258][Some people]] make this trick part of their workflow.

NB: this workaround won't help the in-buffer completions provided by =org-node-complete-at-point-mode=, but with some luck you won't notice.

** Limitation: excluding notes
The option =org-node-filter-fn= works well for excluding TODO items that happen to have an ID, and excluding org-drill items and that sort of thing, but beyond that, it has limited utility because unlike org-roam, *child ID nodes of an excluded node are not excluded!*

So let's say you have a big archive file, fulla IDs, and you want to exclude all of them from appearing in the minibuffer.  Putting a =:ROAM_EXCLUDE: t= at the top won't do it.  As it stands, what I'd suggest is to use the file name.

While a big selling point of IDs is that you avoid depending on filenames, it's often pragmatic to let up on purism just a bit :-) It works well for me to filter out any file or directory that happens to contain "archive" in the name -- see the last line here:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-node-filter-fn
      (lambda (node)
        (not (or (org-node-get-todo node) ;; Ignore headings with todo state
                 (member "drill" (org-node-get-tags node)) ;; Ignore :drill:
                 (assoc "ROAM_EXCLUDE" (org-node-get-properties node))
                 (string-search "archive" (org-node-get-file-path node))))))
#+end_src

** Limitation: org-ref
We support the builtin @citations, not (yet) org-ref &citations, since it slows down my scan about 50% if I amend =org-link-plain-re= to match them.  You can still find nodes with e.g. =:ROAM_REFS: &citekey=, just not see backlinks.

** Tip: On very slow filesystems

I hear that on Termux on Android, filesystem access can be so slow that it's a pain to cycle dailies with org-roam or org-journal. ([[https://github.com/meedstrom/org-node/issues/24#issuecomment-2278605819][11 seconds just to goto next daily]]!)

Good news.  You can speed up their functions by making them just look up org-node tables.  One or more of these overrides may interest you:

#+begin_src elisp
(advice-add #'org-roam-list-files :override
            #'org-node-faster-roam-list-files)

(advice-add #'org-roam-dailies--list-files :override
            #'org-node-faster-roam-list-dailies)

(advice-add #'org-roam-dailies--daily-note-p :override
            #'org-node-faster-roam-daily-note-p)

(advice-add #'org-journal--list-files :override
            #'org-node-faster-journal-list-files)
#+end_src

** Tip: Word-wrap in the Roam buffer?
This has nothing to do with org-node, but I actually didn't know this for ages.

If you don't hard-wrap but prefer visual-line-mode or similar ([[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/issues/1862][org-roam#1862]]), you have to enable such modes yourself -- it sensibly doesn't inherit your Org hooks:

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'org-roam-mode-hook #'visual-line-mode)
#+end_src

** Toolbox

Basic commands:

- =org-node-find=
- =org-node-insert-link=
- =org-node-insert-transclusion=
- =org-node-insert-transclusion-as-subtree=
- =org-node-visit-random=
- =org-node-series-dispatch=
  - Browse node series -- see README
- =org-node-extract-subtree=
  - A bizarro counterpart to =org-roam-extract-subtree=.  Export the subtree at point into a file-level node, *leave a link where the subtree was*, and show the new file as current buffer.
- =org-node-nodeify-entry=
  - (Trivial) Give an ID to the subtree at point, and run the hook =org-node-creation-hook=
- =org-node-insert-heading=
  - (Trivial) Shortcut for =org-insert-heading= + =org-node-nodeify-entry=

Rarer commands:

- =org-node-lint-all-files=
  - Can help you fix a broken setup: it runs org-lint on all known files and generates a report of syntax problems, for you to correct at will.  Org-node [[https://github.com/meedstrom/org-node/issues/8#issuecomment-2101316447][assumes all files have valid syntax]], though many of the problems reported by org-lint are survivable.
- =org-node-list-dead-links=
  - List links where the destination ID could not be found
- =org-node-list-reflinks=
  - List citations and non-ID links
- =org-node-rewrite-links-ask=
  - Look for link descriptions that got out of sync with the corresponding node title, then prompt at each link to update it
- =org-node-rename-file-by-title=
  - Auto-rename the file based on the current =#+title=
    - Works as an after-save-hook!  Does nothing until you configure =org-node-renames-allowed-dirs=.
- =org-node-backlink-fix-all=
  - Update =BACKLINKS= property in all nodes
- =org-node-grep=
  - (Requires [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]]) Grep across all known Org files.  Very useful combined with [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][embark]]-export & [[wgrep][wgrep]], to search-and-replace a given string everywhere in every directory, for example to rename a tag everywhere.
- =org-node-list-feedback-arcs=
  - (Requires GNU R) Explore [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback_arc_set][feedback arcs]] in your ID link network.  Can be a nice [[https://edstrom.dev/zvjjm/slipbox-workflow#ttqyc][occasional QA routine]].
- =org-node-rename-asset-and-rewrite-links=
  - Interactively rename an asset such as an image file and try to update all Org links to them.  Requires [[https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-wgrep][wgrep]].
    - NOTE: For now, it only looks for links inside the root directory that it prompts you for, and sub and sub-subdirectories and so on -- but won't find a link outside that root directory.

      Like if you have Org files under /mnt linking to assets in /home, those links won't be updated.  Neither if you choose ~/org/subdir as the root directory will links in ~/org/file.org be updated.
