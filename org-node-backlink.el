;;;; Link-insertion advice

;; This logic is independent from the per-buffer validation, because that
;; operates on the file being saved -- in other words, making the file
;; navel-gaze its own content to see if it looks correct according to current
;; links tables.  Technically, that would be enough to result in correct
;; backlinks everywhere if you just run it on all files, and that's
;; more-or-less how `org-node-backlink-fix-all' works, but we don't want to do
;; that on every save.

;; By contrast, the below code does not look up tables, just reacts to the
;; exact link being inserted, which has two benefits:

;; 1. You can observe backlinks appearing in realtime before a buffer is saved

;; 2. It's actually necessary, because a link being inserted does not mean we
;;    should check the current file but rather visit and edit the target file.
;;    If we didn't have the below code, we'd have save the current buffer (in
;;    order to update tables) and then open the target file and run
;;    `org-node-backlink--fix-whole-buffer', which can easily take a while for
;;    a big target file.
